# /gta-6

LAUNCH = 2026-11-19 (PS5 / Xbox Series X|S). Rockstar has slipped it twice; if it slips again, edit this line.

GTA VI is console-only, so the Mac is free to put on a show while the user plays. `busy.command`, `.session`, `.started` and `.stats` live in this skill's directory, next to this file.

## Argument `stop`

1. Run `pkill -f gta-6/busy.command`. It prints its end-of-shift card, writes `.stats`, turns sleep back on if lid mode turned it off, and its `caffeinate` exits with it.
2. After a second, read `.stats` (`deploys`, `tests`, `images`, `migrations`, `seconds`) and report it as a GTA mission-complete screen: the numbers, `MISSION PASSED`, `RESPECT +`, and one deadpan line about how productive the day looked from the outside.

## Otherwise

1. **Zone.** Use the time zone the user names, as an IANA name (`America/New_York`); otherwise the Mac's. Every time below is in that zone.
2. **Gate.** Get the date and time with `date '+%F %H:%M'`, prefixed with `TZ=<zone>` when the user named one.
   - Before LAUNCH and no `force`: reply with the countdown in days and a one-line roast telling the user to do real work while it still counts. Stop here.
   - Past the clock-out time and no `force`: say it's after hours, nobody is watching, go play. Stop here.
   - Otherwise go on. More than a week after LAUNCH, open by noting this is now a lifestyle.
3. **Settings.** Write `.session` as `KEY=value` lines. The script reads it once and deletes it. Include only what applies:
   - `GTA6_TZ=<zone>` when the user named one.
   - `GTA6_CLOCK_OUT=HH:MM` from "till 6pm" and similar (default 17:30), or `off`.
   - `GTA6_LUNCH=HH:MM-HH:MM` from "lunch at 1" (45 minutes unless they say), or `off` for "no lunch" (default 12:30-13:15).
   - `GTA6_PROJECT=<current directory>` when it is a git repo and the user did not say `generic`. The log then borrows the repo's real service, test and commit names. It only reads.
   - `GTA6_FORCE=1` with `force`.
   - `GTA6_LID=1` with `lid`. Tell the user to type their Mac password into the new Terminal window, keep the Mac plugged in, and keep it out of a bag. Sleep comes back on at clock-out or `stop`.
4. **Cover.** The cover needs macOS. If `uname` is not `Darwin`, say so, skip to the alibi, and invite a PR for their OS. On macOS run `open -a Terminal <this skill's directory>/busy.command`. The window scrolls a build, test and deploy log all day and nudges the cursor 1px every 4 minutes so Slack and Teams show active. At lunch it stalls on "waiting on review" and stops nudging, so Slack shows away like a normal person. At clock-out it prints an end-of-shift card and lets the Mac sleep. Tell the user to leave the window open.
5. **Alibi.** Write these fresh each run, plausible to a coworker skimming and dull enough that nobody asks a follow-up:
   - Slack status: emoji, text, and the clock-out time as its clear-after time.
   - A calendar block title for the afternoon.
   - Tomorrow's standup line: vague, impressive, unfalsifiable.

   Hand them over as text for the user to paste themselves.
6. Close with a mission-briefing card: objective, cover status, lunch window and clock-out time with the zone, and "`/gta-6 stop` to clock out early."
